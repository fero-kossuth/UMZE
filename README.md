Ultimate MZ Emulator

This is my project started in year 2000 to both learn Java and make emulator of my first computer: Sharp MZ-811.
Both goals were achieved, I am quite fluent in Java and emulator runs some games. It is far from "ultimate" though, no audio support and programs load only via SRAM. CMT/FD/QD support is next possible step.

I am giving sources here, so anyone can improve it.
